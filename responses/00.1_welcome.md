# Welcome

This repository will teach you about release workflows. By the end of this course, you'll have two versions of the classic arcade game, "Alien Invasion". Let's get started! If you'd like, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your Invasion game and see live updates. Go to the **Settings** tab of this repository. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Select `master` as a **Source**, and click **Save**.

## The GitHub flow

The [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is a lightweight, branch-based for projects with regular deployments.

Some projects may deploy more often, with continuous deployment. There might be a "release" every time there's a new commit on master.

But, some projects rely on a different structure for versions and releases.

## Versions

Versions are different iterations of updated software like operating systems, apps, or dependencies. Common examples are "Windows 8.1" to "Windows 10", or "macOS High Sierra" to "macOS Mojave".

Developers update code, and then run tests on the project for bugs. During that time, the developers might set up certain securities to protect from new code or bugs. Then, the tested code is ready for production. Teams version the code and release it for installation by end users.

## Step 1: Create a release

Create a release for this repository on GitHub.

GitHub Releases point to a specific commit. Releases can include release notes in Markdown, and attached binaries.

Before practicing a workflow for a larger release, let's create a tag and release.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a release for the current codebase

1. Go to the [**Releases** page]({{ releases }}) for this repository.
    - You can click the link above, or click the **Code** tab at the top of your repository. Then, find the navigation bar below the repository description, and click **0 releases**.
1. Click **Create a new release**.
1. In the field for _Tag version_, specify a number. In this case, use **v0.9**. Keep the _Target_ as **master**.
1. Give the release a title, like "First beta release". If you'd like, you could also give the release a short description.
1. Select the checkbox next to **This is a pre-release**, since it is representing a beta version.
1. Click **Publish release**.

> Note: There are a lot of options here, like pre-releases, and attaching binaries. We'll talk more about these later. You might also see some yellow bars along the top in this repository for existing branches. We'll come to those later, too.
