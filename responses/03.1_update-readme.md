## Release management

As you prepare for a future release, you'll need to organize more than the tasks and features. It's important to create a clear workflow for your team, and to make sure that the work remains organized.

There are several strategies for managing releases. Some teams might use long-lived branches, like `production`, `dev`, and `master`. Some teams use simple feature branches, releasing from the master branch.

No one strategy is better than another. We always recommend being intentional about branches and reducing long-lived branches whenever possible.

In this exercise, you'll use the `release-v1.0` branch to be your one long-lived branch per release version.

## Protected branches

Like the `master` branch, you can protect release branches. This means you can protect branches from force pushes or accidental deletion. This is already configured in this repository.

## Add a feature

Releases are usually made of many smaller changes.  This is a practice repository, but we will still make at least two feature adjustments.

Since we don't know of any bugs, we'll focus on a few features to update on our game before the version update.

- You should update the README.md to point to the correct game URL
- I'll help you change the text colors to green

## Step 4: Open a PR to add a new feature

First, update the URL in your README.md.

Using the GitHub flow, make your update, and open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as your base branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Update the README.md

1. Create a new branch and change the URL in the `README.md` to point to your own GitHub Pages site, `https://{{ username }}.github.io/release-based-workflow`
1. Open a pull request with `release-v1.0` as the `base` branch, and your new branch as `compare`.
1. Fill in the pull request template to describe your changes.
1. Add the pull request to the project board, using the **Projects** section on thre right side of the pull request.
