Great work! After you added the **Organizing a release** issue card to the project board, I closed this issue. With project board automation, the card you added to the "In progress" column is now in the "Done" column. 

To check to see if your card moved, check out your [project](https://github.com/{{ user.username }}/{{ repo }}/projects/1).

Your next steps can be found in [your next issue].
