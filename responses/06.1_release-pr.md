## Release branches and `master`

You should open a pull request between your release branch and master as early as possible. It might be open for a long time, and that's okay.  The pull request corresponds to the work in the project board.

The pull request description should:
- Include a brief description of the pull request
- Include a task list of expected features
- Propose a ship date

To expedite the creation of this pull request, I've added a pull request template to the repository. Now when you create a pull request, default text will automatically be displayed, this should help you identify and fill out all the necessary information. If you don't want to use the template content, just remove the text from the pull request and repace it with your pull request message.

### Step 7: Open a release pull request

Let's make a new pull request comparing the `release` branch to the `master` branch.
